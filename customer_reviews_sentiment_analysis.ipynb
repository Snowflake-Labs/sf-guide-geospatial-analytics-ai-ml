Additionaly click on the `Packages` tab in the top of the Notebook and add `pydeck` and `branca` to the list of packages as our app will be using them. \n\nThis lab will show you how to inject AI into your spatial analysis using Cortex Large Language Model (LLM) Functions to help you take your product and marketing strategy to the next level. Specifically, you’re going to build a data application that gives food delivery companies the ability to explore the sentiments of customers in the Greater Bay Area. To do this, you use the Cortex LLM Complete Function to classify customer sentiment and extract the underlying reasons for that sentiment from a customer review. Then you use the Discrete [Global Grid H3](https://www.uber.com/en-DE/blog/h3/) for visualizing and exploring spatial data. \n\n### Step 1. Data acquisition\n\nTo complete the project you will use a synthetic dataset with delivery orders with the feedback for each order. We will simplify the task of data acquisition by putting the dataset in an S3 bucket, which you will connect as an external stage.\n\nFirst specify the default Database, Schema and the Warehouse and create a file format that corresponds to the format of the trip and holiday data we stored in S3. Run the following queries:\n"

For complex aspect-based sentiment analysis like this, you are going to pick the mixtral-8x7b, a very capable open-source LLM created by Mistral AI. \n* **Overall Sentiment** assigns an overall rating of the delivery: Very Positive, Positive, Neutral, Mixed, Negative, Very Negative, or other. \n* **Sentiment Categories** give us richer insights into why the overall rating is based on Food Cost, Quality, and Delivery Time. \n\nAs a general rule when writing a prompt, the instructions have to be simple, clear, and complete. For example, you will notice that you clearly define the task as classifying customer reviews into specific categories. It’s important to define constraints of the desired output, otherwise the LLM will produce unexpected output. Below, you specifically tell the LLM to categorize anything it is not sure of as Other, and explicitly tell it to respond in JSON format. "

When you select `DELIVERY_LOCATION` as a Dimension and `ORDERS` as a Measure you'll see what areas correspond to the high number of orders. You can use scale 7 and zoom in to identify clear clusters of where the most deliveries are occurring. In this case you see most deliveries are in Santa Clara, San Jose, and the San Francisco Bay. In particular, the area on the San Francisco peninsula looks to be an area of interest. Zooming in further you can see a dense area of delivery orders. \n\nUsing a finer H3 resolution, 8 shows how the delivery densities are distributed more finely. From this resolution, you can see the orders are concentrated in Daly City and proceed down to San Bruno. Additionally, in the North, the majority of the orders are coming from the stretch of the Sunset District to the Mission District.\n\nNow that you know where the majority of orders are coming from, let's analyze whether there are interesting differences in customer satisfaction depending on where they are located. Select `DELIVERY LOCATION` as a dimension and `SENTIMENT_SCORE` as a Measure to see the overall sentiment score that the Cortex LLM Complete Function generated. You can notice that the customers are mostly satisfied in the areas of Daly City down to San Jose, in the Santa Rosa area, and around Dublin. You also see that the area between these is mostly showing unhappy customers.\n\nIn order to understand why customers in this area are unhappy, you analyze the aspect based sentiment results of the Cortex LLM Complete Function generated  for the categories of interest: food cost, delivery time, and the food quality. If you focus purely on the customers that were unhappy, you see that the primary reasons are food quality and food cost getting poor scores. Essentially, the food is not worth the cost and delivery time being fast does not make up for this. Check visualizations using the following combinations of parameters:\n\nIf you look at all H3 cells where food quality was high, the average sentiment score is also generally high. Again, you can see there are no cells where customers felt the food quality was above average in the greater Berkeley area. This could indicate either that high quality delivery food is uncommon or that the customers in these areas have higher expectations for delivery food.\n\nYou can also analyze what areas are getting higher scores for each of the categories and how it correlates with the overall sentiment scores for restaurants in each area.\n\nThe code from this quickstart can be reused for other industries, such as urban mobility, retail, finance, etc. Basically, any industry that involves providing a service with geo components and customer reviews."
