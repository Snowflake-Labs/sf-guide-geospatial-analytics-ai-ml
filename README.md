# Geospatial Analytics, AI and ML using Snowflake
### Overview

In this quickstart, you will use Geospatial functions, Time Series, Cortex ML and Streamlit for Analytics, ML and AI use cases. The quickstart is broken up into separate labs:

- [Lab 1: Geospatial 101](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sf-guide-geospatial-analytics-ai-ml/blob/main/geospatial_101.ipynb)
- [Lab 2: Geocoding and Reverse Geocoding](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sf-guide-geospatial-analytics-ai-ml/blob/main/geocoding_and_reverse_geocoding.ipynb)
- Lab 3: Forecasting time series on a map
- Lab 4: Sentiment analysis of customer reviews
- Lab 5: [Processing unstructured geospatial data](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sf-guide-geospatial-analytics-ai-ml/blob/main/processing_unstructured_geospatial_data.ipynb)

When you complete this quickstart, you will have gained practical experience in several areas:
- Acquiring data from the Snowflake Marketplace
- Loading data from external storage
- Transforming data using H3 and Time Series functions
- Training models and predicting results with Cortex ML
- Using LLM for analysing textual data
- Using free datasets from Marketplace for geocoding and reverse geocoding
- Visualizing data with Streamlit
